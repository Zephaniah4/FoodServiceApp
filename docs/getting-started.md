# Getting Started

Welcome to the FoodServiceApp! This guide will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- (Optional) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred code editor

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FoodServiceApp.git
   cd FoodServiceApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the client:**

   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   If you have a server or backend, repeat the process in that directory.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the client:**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

2. **(Optional) Start the backend/server:**

   If your project includes a backend, follow the instructions in the backend's README or documentation to start it.
