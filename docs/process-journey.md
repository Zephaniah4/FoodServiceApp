# Process Journey

The following outlines the typical process for individuals or families receiving free grocery assistance through the drive-thru locations supported by FoodServiceApp:

1. **Arrival and Check-In**  
   When an individual or family arrives at a free grocery assistance drive-thru location, a staff member directs the driver to access the FoodServiceApp website. This can be done by providing a URL or QR code for use on their personal device, or by offering a tablet in kiosk mode if needed.  
   The website guides the user to a check-in page, where they enter information about themselves and their household, and complete any required forms for reporting purposes. Once submitted, the driver is checked in and added to the driver queue.

2. **Queue and Verification**  
   After check-in, the driver waits in the line of cars. Upon reaching the first stop, staff verify the driver’s check-in status by referencing the driver queue in the admin view of the website. Once verified, the driver proceeds to the next stop.

3. **Grocery Distribution**  
   At the second stop, staff load groceries into the driver’s vehicle. After receiving their groceries, the driver exits the distribution area.

4. **Post-Event Data Management**  
   After the event, staff review the driver queue and manually upload each driver’s data and completed forms to the nourishment assistance program’s website for reporting and compliance.
